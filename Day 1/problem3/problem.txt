Problem: Can Two Strings Become Anagram by Changing at Most One Character?
Given two strings s1 and s2 of same length,
check if they can become anagrams of each other by changing at most one character in either string.

Input: s1 = "abcde", s2 = "abfde"
Output: true  // change 'f' to 'c' in s2 â†’ becomes anagram

Input: s1 = "aabb", s2 = "abbb"
Output: true  // change one 'b' in s2 to 'a'

Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "aacc"
Output: false  // need to change more than 1 character

Input: s1 = "race", s2 = "care"
Output: true  // already anagram (0 changes)


=============================
Rules
=============================

Strings must be of equal length

Ignore case and spaces

Can modify at most one character (in any one string)

Return true or false
