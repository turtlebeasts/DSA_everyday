Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to target.
If there is no such subarray, return 0.

Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length = 2.

Input: target = 15, nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 5

Input: target = 100, nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
